This is a revised version of "Bryan's" version of Wilfredo SÃ¡nchez's old DropScript utility.

DropScript is a utility for easy conversion of Unix commandline applications and shell scripts into standalone Mac OS X application bundles, so-called "droplets".
Just drop the file to be converted onto the DropScript app, and the converted application will be placed alongside the original file.

The original behaviour of "droplets" created this way was to pass on the names of all dropped files to the embedded shell script or commandline utility.

Modifications I made:

- I added the possibility to launch the droplet without dropping any files onto it, in which case the script (or utility) is launched without arguments.

- Launching the DropScript app itself without dropping a file onto it will open as a standard application. Use the Open menu item to select a script, binary executable or even a Finder alias to create a Droplet with. Use the New menu item to create and open a new file in the default text editor, allowing to create a script from scratch

- Launching a droplet by command-double-clicking its icon will open the embedded script in the default text editor.

- I modified the Xcode project for building on 10.6 and higher; there's also an Xcode project for 10.9 and higher

ToDo: set the icon based on the original file's icon (it it has one)
